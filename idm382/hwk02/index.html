        <br>
        <li>The LED strip customization of the lighting systems in the app works well, and the user can customize color, brightness, and light effects to the user's personal requests.</li>
        <li>The LED lighting allows you remote control through smartphone apps or iPad, enabling simple lighting control from anywhere.</li>
        <li>Led Lighting includes a feature in the app for newcomers to add the device by connecting the Bluetooth and upgrading the version may help the version develop bugs or compatibility issues to make the interface not become Latency or make it quicker as connected.</li>
        <li>The app has an intriguing feature called Harmony Lab. It is sound effects that are used to enhance the surrounding immersion of the lights. For example, if the sound is like rain, the light will match it from the app connection. Furthermore, it may be immediately connected to Wifi.</li>
        <li>The UI is colorful and simple to use, with intuitive controls.</li>

   <h1>What do they NOT do well?</h1>
        <li>According to the research, it does not appear to be compatible with Alexa or Google Assistant and is mostly controlled via an app.</li>
        <li>It is possible that this is a false advertisement picture.</li>
        <li>Without Morse code and other things that the user would expect to see in the UI.</li>
        <li>Despite the fact that this product costs $50 and the quality isn't great, there's a chance that half of the lights may flash different colors from the interface after an extended period of use.</li>
        <li>The research discovered that worked for 6 hours. The user switched it on once more, and 75% of the strip was no longer light. This suggests it's a problem with troubleshooting.</li>
        <li>There is a likelihood that the Bluetooth connection could fail frequently, and lights have a point in it.</li>
        <li>It is difficult to remove the paint from the wall that has been glued on by the physical light.</li>

    <h1>Is the software making the best use (UXID) of the hardware or is it just doing the "Same O Same O"</h1>
    <br>
<p>
    This hardware may not be the best used since I see it competing with the same company hardware that is another version, maybe an additional upgrade, similar to the iPhone or Apple updating. However, the feedback or review was less than 1k than the original, despite the fact that I had about 60k review feedback. Failure to compare $50 and the original $25 will result in uncertainty about the differences between the interface designs, as both may be qualitatively different. In addition, the font gray color on the button appears to have at least 65% opacity, indicating that it would be difficult to read.
</p>
</div>

<h1> Summary</h1>
<p>
    The Govee 32.8ft RGBIC LED strip is an alternate version or design of the same company's LED strip, and it's a multifunctional lighting fixture meant to be used in a variety of environments, including play areas and bedrooms. It may be easily customized because of Bluetooth control. It also provides 64 distinct picture settings, intelligent color selection, and music synchronization. Two rolls of 16.4-foot LED strips are included in the bundle, offering plenty of coverage for imaginative lighting arrangements.

<h1>What do they do well?</h1>

<li>Allow users to customization of the lighting systems in the app and l, and the user can customize color, brightness, and light effects.</li>
<li>The LED lighting allows you to remote control through a smartphone, iPad, and smartwatch, enabling simple lighting control from anywhere.</li>
<li>It may be immediately connected to Wifi.</li>
<li>Have a feature in the app for newcomers to add the device by taping “Add Device” in the app.</li>
<li>It is only compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant operated via an app.</li>
<li>Have the physical backup remote control operating the smart LED light.</li>



<h1>What do they NOT do well?</h1>
<li>Since this is just connected to wifi, there is the possibility of hardware device or interface problems or malfunction over time. This means that if you don't have wifi, you won't be able to use the app.</li>
<li>The research found that users giving feedback about the UI or software app was terrible and awful customization options are supremely limited. </li>
<li>Could be false advertising and rumor said that doesnt include the extend strip’s instructions to allow user experience know how to use it. </li>
<li>The interface is unintuitive and only a color wheel to use for custom color and you cannot type in the color codes such as #88888 hues.</li>
<li>Unable to link 2 sets together since is make setting stuck for strip light and must use 1 at a time.</li>
<li>Not a Bluetooth connection and this device requires you to set up a separate 2.4Ghz WiFi network, and it won’t connect to a dual-band 2.4/5Ghz network.</li>
<li>A pain point to ripped up the wall’s paint that the physical led light glue on it.</li>

    <h1> Summary</h1>
    <p>
        The TP-Link Tapo RGCWIC Smart LED Light has a brightness of 1000 lumens and measures 16.4 feet in length. With 50 color zones and 16 million dimmable hues, it offers a broad variety of lighting. Popular home automation technologies like Apple, Google Assistant, and Alexa are all compatible with this smart light. It also features an IP44 PU covering for weather protection and sound syncing.

<h1> Prototype Concept</h1>
<p>Since many people are unfamiliar with the morse code language, my concept in Figma was Morse code that sent the message code or had a camera capability to translate the morse code through the phone. I've also chosen a new title the prototype apps FlashSign, which is my brand name idea. 
    To get a prototype idea started, I'd need to design the app interface, which would have features for entering message as a button for sending them to the LED strip. It is recognized as sending light morse code. 
    The use of a smartphone app to connect the app and the LED strip would show how messages are sent from the app to the LED strip. Labeling or descriptions that offer context and describe the various features and interactions inside the prototype are also included. Furthermore, customizing the colors and design elements would make my Morse code LED strip idea more appealing.
